### About `GuessTheMovie` Game

This is the second JAVA project from my university. But, it's first for me. Because, I've missed the first one.

This game will randomly pick a movie name from a pre-defined movie list. You'll have to guess the name.

While playing this game, enter a character from your guessed name. If your character is in the randomly selected movie name. The character will be displayed. Otherwise, you'll lose a point.

Keep entering characters. If you lose 10 points, you'll lose the game. You'll win the game if you can guess all the characters correctly before losing 10 points.
